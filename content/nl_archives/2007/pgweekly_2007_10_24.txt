THE DIGITAL LIBRARY FOR DISABLED PERSONS (BNH, FRANCE)

by Marie Lebert, October 2007

The Digital Library for Disabled Persons (BnH: Bibliotheque Numerique pour
le Handicap) is a novel project compared to other current projects. For the
first time, public service offers an adapted access to books, not an access
to adapted books. This project was launched by the City of
Boulogne-Billancourt, located near Paris, France. The project manager is
Alain Patez, who is a digital librarian at the City Library. After an
experimental phase from January 2006 to September 2007, the BnH is now open
to all disabled persons, whatever the handicap, permanent or temporary, and
wherever they live in metropolitan France, for now. The BnH wants to operate
as a public library does, i.e. to buy recent books - in this case, digital
books: fiction, non-fiction, best-sellers, etc. - and make them available in
various formats to its members. Its principles are to provide easy access to
these books on standard hardware (desktop computers, laptop computers, PDAs,
smartphones, etc.) and free software, while respecting the rights of authors
and publishers. The technical platform of the BnH is run by Numilog, the main
company specializing in the distribution of digital books.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
