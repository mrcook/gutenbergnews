FEATURED NEWS
-------------

Congratulations to Project Gutenberg Australia for reaching ebook number #1500
Here are some words from both Colin Choat and Michael Hart.


                  MILESTONES AT PROJECT GUTENBERG OF AUSTRALIA
                                by Colin Choat

Recently we added ebook #1500 to our collection. One does not usually single
out a volunteer for mention but it seems appropriate on this occasion.
Significantly, the ebook was provided by Don Lainson of Canada and was his
250th contribution to Project Gutenberg of Australia. When one considers that
many of the titles making up our 1500 titles are short stories which appeared
in magazines and periodicals, the 'weight' of Don's contribution is even more
impressive.

Don became a volunteer in 2001, soon after Project Gutenberg of Australia was
started. His first book (our 14th) was 'Bush Studies' by Barbara Baynton.
He soon followed up with works by Edgar Rice Burroughs, D H Lawrence, George
Orwell and F Scott Fitfgerald and his book list is now an impressive one of
classics and bestsellers, interspersed with lighter works. Don's work with
Project Gutenberg of Australia followed a period during which he submitted
books to Project Gutenberg in the United States.

One does not boast a collection of 1500 ebooks without the help of MANY
volunteers and there have been many who have submitted many books. One does not
usually single out one name for recognition, for fear of overlooking others.
I could not, however, let the occasion pass without acknowledgment of Don's
contribution to the success of Project Gutenberg of Australia.

Our ebook #1500 is 'A Scot's Quair' by Lewis Grassic Gibbon, a landmark work
in Scottish literature, set against the background of the First World War and
the industrial unrest and poverty of the nineteen thirties. 'A Scot's Quair'
can be accessed from http://gutenberg.net.au/plusfifty-a-m.html#gibbon.


           CONGRATULATIONS TO PG OF AUSTRALIA ON THEIR 1500TH EBOOK.

Many thanks and congratulations to Project Gutenberg of Australia on their
1500th eBook!!! Since it took me and many volunteers the years from
1971 to 1998 to get from 1 to 1500, I can certainly do some serious
appreciating of the effort and stamina required, and I also know a little
of the volunteerism of Australia, though not nearly enough, I am sure.

My most heartfelt congratulations!!!

Michael S. Hart
Founder, Project Gutenberg

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
