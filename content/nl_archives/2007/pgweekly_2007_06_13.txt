SOFTWARE FOR OFFLINE READING OF PG EBOOKS

  by George Davis

Project Gutenberg is a web-based electronic re-publisher of (primarily)
public domain works.  Being web-based, most of the eBooks in the collection
are readable in a web browser, either on-line or off-line, regardless of
computer operating systems.  While on-line reading is possible, most users
download the eBooks for reading off-line.

It is safe to say that the largest number of readers of PG eBooks do so with
computers based on the Windows operating system.  For reading eBooks, either
a web browser (most often Internet Explorer) or Windows Notepad are the two
most recommended programs.

But those are not necessarily the best applications for the purpose.  Notepad
is primarily a text editor, not a file viewer; and using a web browser for
reading eBooks is -- at least some of the time -- something like using an
18-wheeler to do your grocery shopping.  Fortunately, there are a few other
options out there which cost nothing but the time to download -- they are
freeware -- and offer a more user-friendly interface with eBooks.

You can find alternatives by searching the internet for "etext readers",
"ebook readers", "file viewers", and so on.  But to get you started, here are
a couple of suggestions:

WnBrowse is a file viewer, for viewing text files, as well as HEX and EBCDIC
(don't bother with these last two, PG doesn't offer eBooks in these formats).
It works really well with plain text as well as 8-bit text files (those with
accented characters); and depending on your system configuration, it will
probably work with Unicode files.  It's easy to adjust it's interface,
including font, font size, text color and background color.  Take a look at
http://www.ngthomas.co.uk/wnbrowse.html.

The next two are eBook readers, that is, they were designed for reading
eBooks, and are particularly useful for those from Project Gutenberg; they
both enhance the eBook reading experience, especially in comparison to a text
editor or a file viewer.

Of particular note is that both of the following programs automatically
reformat the paragraphs in PG's plain text files, removing the hard carriage
returns at the end of each line.  That results in making these files much more
readable.

yBook Reader (http://www.spacejock.com/yBook.html):  a free ebook reader that
visually "simulates" the look and feel of an actual paperback (see screenshot)
and supports TXT, HTML, RTF, PDB and PRC ebook formats.  (Note that at this
time, HTML with images cannot be viewed within the downloaded HTML zip files;
they must be extracted in the same folder structure as contained in the zip
file, i.e. images in the \images directory, etc.).  yBook includes a number of
useful features such as bookmarking, search, and custom formatting capabilities.

Basically, yBook provides a "paper book" simulation on the computer screen:
you have two pages side-by-side instead of just one in the middle of your
screen (it can be configured for viewing in single-page mode, suitable for
tablet-type PCs in portrait mode); the pages turn when you click them.
Also: runs on any Windows PC (Win95 or later); resize the pages, adjust the
margins, set text and paper colour; text search for words or phrases;
bookmarks; text sizes from tiny to HUGE; no zooming, panning or scrolling;
automated direct download of selected PG eBooks, with index; internationalized
menus (Spanish, German, etc.).

One additional option:  yBook can be installed to a memory stick, AKA a USB
drive; see the web site for more information.

The second eBook reader which you might want to look at is Tom's eTextReader
(aka, eTR).  You can find it at http://pws.prserv.net/Fellner/Software/eTR.htm.
Note that some of the more advanced features are part of the current
(as of May 2007) beta version of the software.  If you know what that means,
and are comfortable with using beta software, then don't hesitate to look at
this program.  For what it's worth, this writer has been using the latest beta
version (1.9.1) for some time now without any problems.
Your mileage may vary! <g>

Like yBook, eTextReader enables you to read the plain text files in a
book-like manner.  Again, you can change the font type and size, choose colors
for text background, set bookmarks, adjust margins, find words or phrases and
more. The program can open the text files directly from the Project Gutenberg
zip file, and also import RTF and HTML files. Other features include text
editing, table of contents creation and more.

Like yBook, eTR also includes a "PG Browser":  an interface for selecting and
downloading eBooks directly from Project Gutenberg.

eTR works with MS Word DOC files (those with the file extension .doc); yBook
reader doesn't.  (Probably not an issue, as there are very few DOC files in
the collection.)

One other program worth considering:  eTextViewer available at
http://etextviewer.firstsolo.net/.
Many of the same basic features as the above, but it doesn't support HTML, and
doesn't have an interface for connecting to PG for direct downloading of
eBooks. It's been around quite a while, is very stable, and handles Unicode
files more than adequately.

All of these programs are worth a look.  This writer has all of them installed,
and uses them interchangeably, with no problems.

(Note:  Project Gutenberg cannot provide any technical assistance or support
for the above, we just don't have the manpower or resources.  But the program
authors have always seemed responsive to queries, and suggestions for
improvements as well as bug reports).

The above are for the Windows platform only.  If anyone out there has
experience with eBook readers for other platforms, consider writing an article
for inclusion in a future issue of the newsletter.


POLL RESULTS

PG WEEKLY NEWSLETTER STATISTICS [TOTALS]. KEEP OR REMOVE?

60% - KEEP ALL stats as they are
35% - Include just the BASICS [Grand Totals]
 5% - REMOVE ALL

Although not too many people voted there is definitely a desire to include
some statistical details in the newsletter. I may try to streamline what is
included a little more but otherwise, I think we will keep things as they are.

Thanks for your input -- Ed.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
