"THE CULT OF THE AMATEUR" (PART I)

A reply to the complaints of the paid professional punditry on the subject of
having lost their previously impermeable media monopoly they are just now only
realizing hit an immoveable iceberg quite a while ago with the Internet, cell
phone, and iPod revolutions.

by Michael S. Hart

"And The Band Played On. . . ."

The Titanics of world media crashed, full speed ahead, into these new media
options years ago. . .and. . .

These people STILL don't realize that half of the world population that will
ever buy cell phones already have done so; nor are their realizations of the
world view in touch with the effects of such a change from one-way media to
two-way media, but are still in shock that the Internet provided media
coverage to bloggers that toppled "The Great and Powerful Oz" in the form of
Dan Rather, while their news reports tried and failed, to make a fake story
about toppling the statue of Saddam Hussein.

The fact that "The Emperor Has No Clothes" is becoming obvious for half the
world population directly via their cell phones, they can see it for
themselves, and can no longer be fooled quite so easily as the United States
Congress was fooled by the faked "Tonkin Gulf Incident" that led to "The Gulf
of Tonkin Resolution" that created The Viet Nam War" in a true homage to
"You supply the pictures and I'll provide the war" of the height of Yellow
Journalism.

If you've been paying attention to the professional media pundits, then you've
probably heard at least some of their complaining from their professional
pulpits that their monopolies on information in the new world of communication
are waning, and that this informing of the public is increasingly being done
more on the order of that "of the people, by the people, for the people," that
was the ideal of the founding fathers of modern democracy.

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
