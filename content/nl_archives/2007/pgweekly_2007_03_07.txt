THIS WEEKS NEWS
---------------

MANY HAPPY RETURNS to Michael Hart on his 60th birthday! (8-March 2007)


DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME - Changes for U.S.A. from 2007

Beginning in 2007, Daylight Saving Time is brought forward by 3 or 4 weeks in
Spring and extended by one week in the Fall.  The schedule for the states of
the United States that adopt daylight saving time will be: 2 a.m. on the
second Sunday of March. Time will revert to standard time at 2 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November.

Daylight Saving Time, for the U.S. and its territories, is NOT observed in
Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the state
of Arizona (not the Navajo Indian Reservation, which does observe). Navajo
Nation participates in the Daylight Saving Time policy, due to its large size
and location in three states.

Daylight Saving Time Schedule USA 2007:

 * Start: Second Sunday in March
 *   End: First Sunday in November
 *  Time: 2 a.m. local time


POLL: SHOULD PG 'OFFICIALLY' ADOPT A XML, TEI OR SIMILAR MASTER FILE?

On the PG-News website I've been running a POLL to find out if people think
PG should 'officially' adopt a XML, TEI or similar Master File format for
their eBooks. Here are the results so far;

YES, this is a must!
  5 (83.3%)

NO, we should stick with Plain-Vanilla ASCII files.
  1 (16.7%)

It's really not that important.
  0 (0%)

I haven't a clue what you're talking about.
  0 (0%)

Although there are not many votes in yet, there is an 83% vote in favour of
adopting a Master File format.

I will be running the POLL for a couple of more weeks, if you wish to vote
please visit the PG-News homepage: https://www.gutenbergnews.org

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non
U.S. clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the
non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Grand Total and not
the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may
move later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
