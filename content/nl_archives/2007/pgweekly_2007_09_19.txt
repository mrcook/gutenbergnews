GUTENBERG ARTICLE WRITERS WANTED

Since my relocation to Germany I'm struggling to find as much time to
research and put together interesting articles for the newsletter, so I'm
putting this request out for volunteers.

You will not be expected to write dozens of articles per week (although you
are welcome :), but if there were just a handful of people writing one per
week or fortnight, this would really help to provide more interesting
content for the newsletter.

Back in August, Marie Lebert wrote the excellent 'The @folio Project' article
and has indicated that she may have one or two more over the coming months.
You could join her and help the PG Newsletter become more than just a stats
listing.

If you're interested please email me: editor [AT] gutenbergnews.org

I look forward to hearing from you.

-- Michael Cook [Ed]



CHANGES TO THE NEWSLETTER COUNTING SYSTEM

This is only a minor change but should bring the PG count into line with the
other projects.

I am going to start taking the count ending Tuesday, NOT including the
Wednesday of the Newsletter. Therefore this weeks count is taken as follows;

WED - 2007-09-12 - 13 new ebooks posted
THU - 2007-09-13 - 14 new
FRI - 2007-09-14 -  9 new
SAT - 2007-09-15 - 19 new
SUN - 2007-09-16 - 21 new
MON - 2007-09-17 -  3 new
TUE - 2007-09-18 - 15 new

WED - 2007-09-19 - This is today's date and these numbers will be counted in
next weeks totals.

The only real difference is in helping me to produce the count, as now I don't
have to take into consideration the 12noon deadline that was previously used.

-- Ed

HOW TO ACCESS (DOWNLOAD) PG EBOOKS
----------------------------------

http://www.gutenberg.org/find
To search by title, author, language and subject.

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/ || ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/
If you know the file's name then point your web browser or FTP program to one
of the master download sites, navigate to the appropriate directory and look
for the first five characters of the file's name. Note that updated eBooks
usually go in their original directory (e.g., etext99, etext00, etc.)

Cell-Phone Ready eBooks

MOBILEBOOKS - http://www.mobilebooks.org
There are over 5,000 PG eBooks in Java (.jar) format that can be downloaded
from the MobileBooks website. There are help pages at the website on how to

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
