NOTES:

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PGAU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

The PG Europe numbers are possibly being counted twice (in PGUS and PGEU).
I am hoping to get this confirmed or denied soon.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.

responsibility of the donating eLibraries, and we would be happy to forward
any suggestions for correction to those eLibraries, but those eBooks must be
