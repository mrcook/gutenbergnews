This Weeks News Update
----------------------

         MERRY XMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR! MERRY XMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR!

* On 25th December 2006, PG Europe hit the 400 eBooks mark!!
* OOPS! - I had been calculating the totals for 2006 incorrectly. I was
  including the totals for the last week of 2005. This has now been corrected.


                   MOVING FROM 2006 TO 2007, PART 1 [extract]
                                by Michael Hart

Can you imagine carrying all the books from a public library on your keychain?
That became possible in 2006.

How about carrying the entire Library of Congress?
That will become possible well before 2020.

At prices we can afford, here is the timetable:

2000 = 32 Megabytes
2010 = 32 Gigabytes
2020 = 32 Terabytes

32 terabytes is larger than anyone's estimation of how much a collection as
large as The Library of Congress would take for every word to be stored in
your personal computer.

32 gigabyte thumbdrives made their appearance in 2006, enough memory in a
flashdrive to carry tens of thousands of books on a keychain. While these are
not year affordable to an average person today, they will be by 2010.

32 megabytes was the size of my own first USB memory stick in about the
year 2000, now pretty much of only antique value to someone such as myself,
but they still sell them at Target on the "impulse buy" racks next to the
checkout lanes for $5.

that's ~269 eBooks per Month for ~71.75 Months.


NOTES:

We have several counting methods that often differ by several books. There
is also some duplication between the various collections. Volunteers will
need to take these duplications into account.

The PG Australia total does NOT include PGAU eBooks posted at the U.S.
website; www.gutenberg.org.

The PG Europe numbers are possibly being counted twice (in PGUS and PGEU).
I am hoping to get this confirmed or denied soon.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that sometimes it takes a few weeks for entire collections to fully
appear in the PrePrints Section, thus the count sometimes jumps by a large
number when the files are eventually completed and added in. Also note that the
PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move later to other
locations, including the main collection or The Project Gutenberg Consortia
Center, etc. For example, on June 14, 200 WAP compatible cell phone eBooks
appeared, and will likely be moved to other collection points later.
The entire process of working out the details just to send them to the
PrePrints Section took well over a month.
Even with the speeded up process of the PrePrints Section, it still takes a
certain amount of time to collect and put such a large collection online in a
proper manner.
