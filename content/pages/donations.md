Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers over more than 50 years. Your donations make it possible to support these volunteers, and pay our few employees to continue the creation of free electronic texts.

For more information, including several other ways to donate, please visit the official Gutenberg website;

GutenbergNews is a wholly independent project of volunteers, operated in support of the Project Gutenberg mission. We receive no funding from Project Gutenberg or the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. We donate our time and the costs of hosting and registration of the domain name.
