NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
