DIGITIZED BRF (BRAILLE) FILES FOR GUTENBERG.ORG EBOOKS

TravelBraille.com is taking requests for Braille transcriptions of
Gutenberg.org eBooks to BRF Braille. The transcriptions will be prepared by a
US Library of Congress Certified Braille Transcriber. There will be NO charge
for this service.

No assurance can or will be given that any particular file will be
transcribed  priority will be given to those files in the Gutenberg Top 100
eBooks, Top 100 eBook Authors, and, quite frankly, the personal taste of the
Transcriber.

Some of these files may require detailed editing as to punctuation, Braille
contraction, formatting, chapter arrangements, etc. Volumes will be
approximately 150K each to make them easier to load into Braille NoteTakers,
etc. Formatting, editing, headers, chapter headings, page numbering, etc. will
meet or exceed 'Formatted Scan Quality'. The files will be structured for both
refreshable Braille and paper embossing.

For now, all requests must be submitted through the
http://www.TravelBraille.com website 'Contact Us' page.

As this will be a free service, your patience will be kindly appreciated.

-- John Edwin Miller, USA Library of Congress Certified Braille Transcriber.


QUOTATIONSBOOK.COM AND PROJECT GUTENBERG

QuotationsBook.com has used Project Gutenberg to match thousands of famous
quotes into the classic books they came from. They've provided a way to view
these quotes, with a link back to the full book - all within the right context.
Here's just one example - http://quotationsbook.com/quote/1392/

POLL: HOW MANY "PG" E-TEXTS HAVE YOU READ?

 * Less than 10
 * 10-20
 * Over 20
 * Over 50
 * Over 100!
 * More than 200!!

After reading Charlie Stross' article, 'Why the Commercial eBook Market is
Broken' (https://www.gutenbergnews.org/content/view/245/39/) I was intrigued to know
how many texts your average PG user has read from the Gutenberg archives.
Here's your chance to show us that you are not just another 'collector' and
are putting PG to good use. Visit the gutenbergnews.org website and place you vote.

...are there any of you who have read OVER 200 PG e-texts?

DP Proofreading doesn't count ;-)

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
