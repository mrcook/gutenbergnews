NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a speadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non
U.S. clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the
non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Grand Total and not
the overall PG-EU total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may
move later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
