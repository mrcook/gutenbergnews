THE NEWSLETTER TEAM IS BORN!

As I'm sure many of you know, I am stepping down as the editor. I've had a
great time and I am very grateful to Michael and Greg for giving me a chance
to try my own ideas for the newsletter, including starting up the gutenbergnews.org
website. If you're wondering, yes, gutenbergnews.org will stay live and up-to-date.
I will continue on as webmaster.

As my last entry I would like to introduce the new Newsletter Team!

With such a great response to our request for a replacement editor, it was a
natural choice to create a team of editors. The new editors, from both sides
of the pond, are Stacey, Jared and Andra.

You can bet they will be digging up some interesting and diverse news relating
to PG, eBooks and publishing in general. Very likely a few surprises too!


Kindest Regards,

Michael Cook

NOTES:

To arrive at the Newsletter statistics a manual count was done on all the
'posted' listings found in the Newsletter Archives. For PG-EU the website
listing was used. All these statistics were then entered into a spreadsheet.

DP-EU is currently concentrating on U.S. copyright clearable eBooks and
therefore many of these are posted to both the PG and PG-EU sites, non U.S.
clearable books posted to PG-EU only. Please note that only the non-clearable
('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and not the overall PG-EU total.

DP-CA - Like the European project this has many books posted to both the PG and
PG-CA sites, non U.S. clearable books posted to PG-CA only. Please note that
only the non-clearable ('Unique') eBooks are counted toward the Totals and
not the overall PG-CA total.

PREPRINTS -- http://preprints.readingroo.ms
Please note that the PrePrint files are just that, PrePrints, and thus may move
later to other locations, including the main collection or The Project
Gutenberg Consortia Center.
